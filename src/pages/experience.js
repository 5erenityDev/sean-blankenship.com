      <h2>Web Intern (Hybrid) | Richmond, KY</h2>
      <h3>January 2025 - Present</h3>
      <p>At Wendell Wilson Business Technology Consulting I was given the chance to begin my career not only in the general field of computer science through web development, but also got a start in the software/gaming field. I was taught the ins and outs of Docker, Drupal, Composer, and many back-end web development concepts. Eventually, I was put onto a project related to testing and benchmarking various games & software through automated means where I made use of various unique programs and coding languages.</p>

      <h1>Eastern Kentucky University</h1>
      <h2>Student (Hybrid) | Richmond, KY</h2>
      <h3>August 2020 - May 2024</h3>
      <p>I worked on several projects with fellow students, building up skills in teamwork, communication, and leadership. I did many solo projects and around 4 team projects, one of which is still going strong even after I have graduated. A strong example of a challenge I overcame with this current team is when me and four other devs received news of Unity's hostile policy towards developers in early September of 2023. We debated greatly if we should switch engines as our project was early in development and sought approval from the Teacher who gave us the green light to do so. I led the charge in transitioning our Unity project into a Godot one and assisted the programmers in learning the new engine as I had picked it up well during the transition process.</p>
